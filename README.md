# Task2Do-server

## About the Project
This project aims to enhance team productivity through smart project management.<br/> 
Our goal is to enable workers to be linked with managers and assigned to relevant projects, facilitating task assignment and deadline management. <br/>
Additionally, we aim to empower workers to break down tasks into subtasks, update task statuses, and submit requests to managers.

Right now, there's a delicate balance in managing time, tasks, and team members that often leads projects to the edge of failure. Some existing solutions help with assigning tasks, but they only scratch the surface. Our aim is to empower workers to manage their time effectively while still following managerial guidance, transforming how projects operate.
